# CarbonEmissionPredictor
I did this project under the SDG-11 assessment during my research intern in CCU Taiwan. Here I collected all the satellite data of NASA for carbon emission in major cities if Taiwan and then with the help of the actual data I comapred these two data and trained an Ai model which can predict the actual approximate CO2 emission data in any city of the world guven its latitude and longitude. My model was 9%.6 % accurate.
