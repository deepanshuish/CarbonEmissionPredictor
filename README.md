# SDG-11 Carbon Emission Prediction

## Overview

This project was conducted as part of the Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG-11) assessment during my research internship at CCU Taiwan. The primary objective was to analyze carbon emission data in major cities of Taiwan using satellite data provided by NASA. We collected and processed the relevant satellite data and compared it with actual carbon emission data.

The main achievement of this project is the development of an AI model capable of predicting approximate CO2 emissions in any city worldwide, based on its latitude and longitude coordinates. The AI model demonstrated an impressive accuracy rate of 97.6%.

## Project Details

- **Data Collection:** We collected and curated satellite data from NASA to gain insights into carbon emissions in major cities across Taiwan.

- **Data Comparison:** We compared the collected satellite data with actual carbon emission data to identify patterns and trends.

- **AI Model Development:** Using PyTorch, scikit-learn, and pyplot, we developed a powerful AI model that can predict CO2 emissions based on geographical coordinates.

- **Accuracy:** The AI model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 97.6%, making it a reliable tool for estimating carbon emissions.

## Technologies Used

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): PyTorch was the primary deep learning framework used for model development and training.

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): scikit-learn facilitated machine learning tasks and model evaluation.

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): We used Matplotlib for data visualization and plotting.

## Usage

You can explore the code and datasets in this repository to gain insights into the project's implementation and results. Feel free to use the AI model for predicting carbon emissions in other cities based on their geographical coordinates.
